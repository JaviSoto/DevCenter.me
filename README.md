DevCenter.me
=

DevCenter.me is a website to easily get to many developer websites for various APIs. It includes a directory of supported sites, as well as memorable URL shortcuts.

Adding Sites
=

The sites are driven from a set of JSON files in the `sites` folder. To add a site to the directory, fork this repository, add a site file, and submit a pull request.

Each site is represented in JSON as a hash mapping to the following keys and values:

- `shortcuts`: an array of shortcuts which are used for generating URLs. Required.
- `name`: a displayable name for the particular developer portal. Required.
- `url`: the URL to redirect to. Required.
- `sortKey`: a key to sort on for display in the directory. If not present, the `name` will be used. Optional.

**Please use hard tabs, not spaces, when adding entries to the JSON file, just to keep things consistent.**

Once your site has been added, there is a test suite, `mocha tests`, which you can run to validate that your shortcuts, id, and URL are not duplicates. This script will be run on all pull requests, and sites which fail this test will either be modified or rejected before being included in the directory.

Installing
=

To run, clone the repository, run `npm install`, and then run `node app`. You can also show a dynamic hostname by setting the `HOSTNAME` environment variable.

DevCenter.me requires node.js v0.8.16 or higher.
